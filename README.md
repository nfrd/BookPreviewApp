# BookPreviewApp

The complete project workspace is included. This iOS app implements NSUrlSession to fetch JSON data in order to show a book's information.
This was a small assignment for a job interview, hence the given project name BuggyApp and later changed to Book Preview.
Build the app in BuggyApp.xcworkspace not Book Preview.xcodeproj (Linker Error will occur).
